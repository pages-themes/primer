# Roopa Kiran

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio. This site showcases my projects and skills in machine learning, data analysis, and algorithms.

## ðŸ“Œ Featured Project: Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a method used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It optimizes the solution by storing intermediate results, reducing redundant calculations. I applied this technique in various scenarios like matrix chain multiplication, shortest path problems, and resource allocation.
